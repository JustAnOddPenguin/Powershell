# DOCX File Management Scripts

This repository contains two Python scripts for managing `.docx` files in a specified directory and its subdirectories. This helps with some troubleshooting and file management when testing.
These scripts allow you to either delete all `.docx` files or move them to another directory.


## Scripts

This script deletes all `.docx` files in a specified directory and its subdirectories.
The first window is the `Source directory` and any files will be deleted from this directory and subdirectories.
#### Usage

1. Save the script to a file, e.g., `delete_docx_files.py`
2. Run the script using Python

### 2. Move all DOCX Files

This script moves all `.docx` files from a specified source directory and its subdirectories to a target directory.
The first window is the `Source directory`, the second is the `target directory`

#### Usage
1. Save the script to a file, e.g., `move_docx_files.py`
